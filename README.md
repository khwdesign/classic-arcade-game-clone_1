Frogger is an 80's arcade game which we were supposed to clone in this web project. The object of the game is to move the character safely across
over to the other side without getting into contact with bugs on the way. A bonus gem is also present that can be obtained if you're fast 
enough!
I was able to include a looped audio file from playonloops.com to give the authentic arcade feel as well! 
Comments are present in the files to further explain the changes made to make the game functional.

In order to run the game, please ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser and then proceed to :

Double-Click on index.html and use your arrow keys to move left or right and forwards and backwards. If you come in contact with any of the ladybugs you will lose a life.
